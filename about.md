Linnea Kirby is a self-proclaimed "Contemporary Renaissance Person," with interests ranging from the creative to the analytical. Linnea recently graduated from Oberlin College, where she discovered a passion for both computer science and the circus arts. She is now constantly devising ways of integrating the two.

Throughout her work, Linnea has explored a range of topics, often imbued with dry wit, including perception of self and of the world, interaction between objects and space, and femininity.

Other talents include over nine years of classical training in ballet and piano, a conversational knowledge of French, and the ability to tie cherry stems into knots with her tongue (not as cool as it sounds).
