<p>Linnea Kirby is a self-proclaimed "Contemporary Renaissance Person," with interests ranging from the creative to the analytical. Linnea recently graduated from Oberlin College, where she discovered a passion for both computer science and the circus arts. She is now constantly devising ways of integrating the two.</p>

<p>Throughout her work, Linnea has explored a range of topics, often imbued with dry wit, including perception of self and of the world, interaction between objects and space, and the bounds of femininity and androgyny.</p>

<p>Other talents include over nine years of classical training in ballet and piano, a conversational knowledge of French, the ability to tie cherry stems into knots with her tongue (not as cool as it sounds), and the ability to put on a pair of sunglasses with her feet (as cool as it sounds).</p>
